## Architecture Overview

Mythic Framework uses a component-based architecture that sets it apart from other frameworks:

```lua
-- Components are registered and fetched using exports
exports['mythic-base']:RegisterComponent('MyComponent', {
    DoSomething = function(self, param)
        -- Your code here
    end
})

-- Other resources fetch and use components
local MyComponent = exports['mythic-base']:FetchComponent('MyComponent')
MyComponent:DoSomething('value')
```

This pattern provides:
- **Modularity**: Resources can be easily added, removed, or replaced
- **Dependency Management**: Automatic dependency resolution
- **Extensibility**: Components can be extended without modifying core code
- **Protection**: Critical components can be marked as protected

<Note>
The component proxy system is the heart of Mythic Framework. Understanding it is essential for development. Learn more in the [Proxy Pattern documentation](/concepts/proxy-pattern).

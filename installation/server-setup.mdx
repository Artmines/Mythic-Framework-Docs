This guide covers downloading the FiveM server, setting up the directory structure, and preparing your server for Mythic Framework installation.

## Download FiveM Server

FiveM server artifacts are updated frequently. Always download the latest stable build.

### Choosing a Build

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Windows">
    **Recommended Build:** Latest recommended build

    1. Visit [FiveM Artifacts](https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_server_windows/master/)
    2. Look for builds marked with **recommended** (green badge)
    3. Download the latest recommended build
    4. Extract to your desired location (e.g., `C:\FiveMServer\`)

    <Tip>
    Avoid the absolute latest build unless you need specific features. Recommended builds are more stable.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Linux">
    **Download via Command Line:**
    ```bash
    # Create server directory
    mkdir -p ~/fivem-server
    cd ~/fivem-server

    # Download latest recommended build
    wget https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_proot_linux/master/[BUILD-NUMBER]/fx.tar.xz

    # Extract
    tar xf fx.tar.xz

    # Make run script executable
    chmod +x run.sh
    ```

    **Find Latest Build Number:**
    Visit [Linux Artifacts](https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_proot_linux/master/) and copy the recommended build number.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### FiveM Server Structure

After extraction, you should have:

```
FiveMServer/
├── FXServer.exe (Windows) or run.sh (Linux)
├── citizen/
├── adhesive.dll / .so
└── (other FiveM files)
```

## Extract Mythic Framework

Now we'll add Mythic Framework to your FiveM server.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Obtain Mythic Framework">
    Extract the Mythic Framework package you received to a temporary location
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy to Server Directory">
    Copy the following folders/files into your FiveM server directory:
    - `resources/` folder
    - `configs/` folder
    - `server.cfg` file
    - `logo96.png` (optional - server icon)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Structure">
    Your server directory should now look like this:
    ```
    FiveMServer/
    ├── FXServer.exe (or run.sh)
    ├── citizen/
    ├── cache/              # Created on first run
    ├── configs/
    │   └── resources.cfg
    ├── resources/
    │   ├── [cfx-default]/
    │   ├── [mythic]/
    │   └── oxmysql/
    ├── server.cfg
    └── logo96.png
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding the Directory Structure

### resources/ Directory

This contains all server resources (scripts, assets, etc.).

```
resources/
├── [cfx-default]/     # Default FiveM resources
│   ├── mapmanager/
│   ├── spawnmanager/
│   ├── sessionmanager/
│   └── ...
├── [mythic]/          # Mythic Framework resources (60+)
│   ├── mythic-base/   # Core framework
│   ├── mythic-characters/
│   ├── mythic-inventory/
│   ├── mythic-hud/
│   └── ...
└── oxmysql/           # MySQL resource
```

<Note>
The `[mythic]` folder naming (with brackets) is important for organization in the server console. FiveM treats folders with brackets as resource categories.
</Note>

### configs/ Directory

Contains resource loading configuration.

```
configs/
└── resources.cfg     # Defines which resources load and in what order
```

<Accordion title="Understanding resources.cfg">
  The `resources.cfg` file is executed by `server.cfg` and contains `ensure` statements that load resources:

  ```bash
  # Load core CFX resources first
  ensure mapmanager
  ensure spawnmanager
  ensure sessionmanager
  ensure baseevents

  # Load oxmysql before Mythic
  ensure oxmysql

  # Load Mythic Framework (load order matters!)
  ensure mythic-base     # Must be first
  ensure mythic-pwnzor   # Anti-cheat second
  ensure mythic-characters
  # ... more resources
  ```

  **Load order is critical** - mythic-base must load before all other Mythic resources.
</Accordion>

### cache/ Directory

Automatically created on first server start. Stores temporary files and build artifacts.

```
cache/
├── files/
├── http-files/
└── (various cache files)
```

<Warning>
Never manually edit files in `cache/`. If you experience issues, you can safely delete the entire cache folder - it will rebuild on next start.
</Warning>

## File Permissions (Linux Only)

On Linux, ensure proper permissions for server files:

```bash
# Set ownership (replace 'youruser' with your username)
sudo chown -R youruser:youruser ~/fivem-server

# Make run script executable
chmod +x ~/fivem-server/run.sh

# Make FXServer executable
chmod +x ~/fivem-server/FXServer

# Set permissions for cache directory (will be created on first run)
chmod 755 ~/fivem-server
```

## Verify Server Files

Before proceeding, verify your installation:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check FiveM Executable">
    Ensure `FXServer.exe` (Windows) or `FXServer` (Linux) exists in the server root
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify server.cfg">
    Confirm `server.cfg` exists in the server root directory
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Resources">
    Verify the `resources/[mythic]/` folder contains 60+ Mythic resources
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm configs/">
    Ensure `configs/resources.cfg` exists
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Optional: Create Backup Structure

It's good practice to keep backups before making changes:

```bash
# Windows (PowerShell)
Copy-Item -Path "C:\FiveMServer" -Destination "C:\FiveMServer_Backup" -Recurse

# Linux
cp -r ~/fivem-server ~/fivem-server_backup
```

<Tip>
Create a backup now (before configuration) so you can easily revert to a clean state if needed.
</Tip>

## Server Startup Scripts

### Windows

Create a `start.bat` file in your server root for easy server starting:

```batch start.bat
@echo off
title Mythic Framework Server
echo Starting Mythic Framework...

FXServer.exe +exec server.cfg

pause
```

### Linux

The `run.sh` script is provided by default. You can customize it:

```bash run.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Set working directory
cd "$(dirname "$0")"

# Start server
exec ./FXServer +exec server.cfg
```

Make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x run.sh
```

## Testing Server Structure

Let's do a quick test to ensure the server can start (it won't fully work yet - we still need database configuration):

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Windows">
    ```bash
    # Navigate to server directory
    cd C:\FiveMServer

    # Try to start (it will fail without database config - that's expected)
    FXServer.exe +exec server.cfg
    ```

    Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the server after seeing initial output.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Linux">
    ```bash
    # Navigate to server directory
    cd ~/fivem-server

    # Try to start
    ./run.sh
    ```

    Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the server after seeing initial output.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**Expected Output:**
- FiveM banner and version info
- License key check (will fail if not configured yet - that's OK)
- Resource scan starting
- You may see errors about database connections - **this is expected** at this stage

<Warning>
If you see "Missing required license key" - that's normal. We'll configure it in the next step.

If the executable doesn't run at all, check:
- File permissions (Linux)
- Antivirus isn't blocking FXServer.exe (Windows)
- You have required .NET Framework (Windows) or dependencies (Linux)
</Warning>

## Common Setup Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="FXServer.exe won't run (Windows)" icon="windows">
    **Solutions:**
    - Install Visual C++ Redistributables: [Microsoft VC++ Downloads](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)
    - Check Windows Defender/antivirus isn't blocking it
    - Run as Administrator (right-click > Run as administrator)
    - Check Windows Event Viewer for specific error details
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Permission denied (Linux)" icon="linux">
    **Solutions:**
    ```bash
    # Make FXServer executable
    chmod +x FXServer
    chmod +x run.sh

    # If still failing, check ownership
    ls -la FXServer
    # Should show your user as owner

    # Fix ownership if needed
    chown youruser:youruser FXServer
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Resources not found" icon="folder-open">
    **Solution:**
    Verify directory structure is correct:
    ```bash
    # Should exist:
    resources/[mythic]/mythic-base/

    # If not, check extraction - files may be nested too deeply
    # Move everything up one level if needed
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Wrong architecture (Linux)" icon="microchip">
    **Error:** `cannot execute binary file: Exec format error`

    **Solution:**
    - Ensure you downloaded Linux build, not Windows
    - Verify your system is 64-bit: `uname -m` (should show x86_64)
    - Re-download the correct Linux artifact
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Directory Structure Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Keep it Organized" icon="folder-tree">
    Maintain separate folders for:
    - Server files (`FiveMServer/`)
    - Backups (`FiveMServer_Backups/`)
    - Development resources (`Dev/`)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Version Control" icon="code-branch">
    Consider using Git for:
    - Custom resources you develop
    - Configuration changes
    - Easy rollback if issues arise
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Next Steps

Your server structure is now set up! Next, configure the databases:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Database Setup" icon="database" href="/installation/database-setup">
    Create and configure MongoDB and MySQL databases
  </Card>
  <Card title="Server Configuration" icon="gear" href="/installation/configuration">
    Configure server.cfg with your settings
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
**Don't start the server fully yet!** Complete the database setup and configuration first to avoid errors.

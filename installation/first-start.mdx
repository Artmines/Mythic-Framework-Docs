## Pre-Start Checklist

Before starting, ensure you've completed:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prerequisites installed">
    MongoDB and MySQL running ✓
  </Step>
  <Step title="Server files extracted">
    Mythic Framework in server directory ✓
  </Step>

</Steps>

<Warning>
If any of these aren't complete, go back and finish them first. Starting with incomplete configuration will cause errors.
</Warning>

## Starting the Server

### Windows

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Using Batch File">
    Create or use `start.bat` in your server root:

    ```batch start.bat
    @echo off
    title Mythic Framework Server
    echo Starting Mythic Framework...
    echo.

    FXServer.exe +exec server.cfg

    pause
    ```

    Double-click `start.bat` to start the server.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Command Line">
    ```bash
    # Open Command Prompt in server directory
    cd C:\Path\To\FiveMServer

    # Start server
    FXServer.exe +exec server.cfg
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Linux

```bash
# Navigate to server directory
cd ~/fivem-server

# Start server
./run.sh

# Or directly:
./FXServer +exec server.cfg
```

### Running as Background Service (Linux)

For production servers, run as a systemd service:

<Accordion title="Create systemd service">
```bash
# Create service file
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/mythic-fivem.service
```

```ini mythic-fivem.service
[Unit]
Description=Mythic Framework FiveM Server
After=network.target mongodb.service mysql.service

[Service]
Type=simple
User=your_username
WorkingDirectory=/home/your_username/fivem-server
ExecStart=/home/your_username/fivem-server/FXServer +exec server.cfg
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=10

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

```bash
# Reload systemd
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

# Enable service (start on boot)
sudo systemctl enable mythic-fivem

# Start service
sudo systemctl start mythic-fivem

# Check status
sudo systemctl status mythic-fivem

# View logs
sudo journalctl -u mythic-fivem -f
```
</Accordion>

## What to Expect

### Console Output

When starting, you'll see:

<Steps>
  <Step title="FiveM Banner">
    ```

    ```
    [Info] Server started
    [Info] Server listening on 0.0.0.0:30120
    [Info] Server is ready!
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
First start may take 2-5 minutes as databases initialize and resources compile. Subsequent starts will be faster.
</Note>

### Expected Initialization

On first start, Mythic Framework will:

1. **Create database collections** (MongoDB)
   - `characters` collection
   - `inventory` collection
   - `users` collection
   - `logs` collection
   - And more...

2. **Create database tables** (MySQL)
   - Various persistent data tables
   - Initialized with defaults

3. **Initialize default data**
   - Default items for inventory
   - Default jobs
   - Default locations
   - System configurations

4. **Create indexes** for performance

All of this happens automatically - you don't need to do anything!

## Verification

### Check Console for Errors

Watch the console for any red error messages:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="✅ No Errors - All Good!" icon="check">
    If you see `[Info] Server is ready!` with no red errors, your server started successfully!
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="❌ Database Connection Errors" icon="database">
    ```
    [Error] Failed to connect to MongoDB
    [Error] MySQL connection failed
    ```

    **Solutions:**
